# A-frame ARJS school project
the past week we have been doing a school project on A-frame and ARJS on what it is and what it does, then we learned how to implement and write with A-frame so we can use our own customized marker that the teacher gave us, that we had to work out from.

the project was that we needed an app, where the group name group members names, and a short description on the project.

the project is not being used for commercial use, and the license we used is MIT, and the authors of the 3D models license are CC-BY-4.0
